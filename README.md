# vue3-suspense

In this example, I learned to use the `vue3-suspense` and state management without the `vuex`.

## Project setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
